# FAQs

## Concourse builds are failing on being unable to read variables!

Most likely the Vault is locked. Use the unseal keys from 1Password and re-run the build.

## How do I access the Vault web ui?

Firstly ask yourself this: Do you really need to?

If so then use the vault cli tool. If that's not enough speak to Mike.

## How do I become less scared running terraform apply?

You don't, fear is healthy when it comes to infra. Remember:

> ## “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”

> Frank Herbert, Dune

Once you understand and live the mantra then you can run terraform apply.
